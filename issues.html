                                            <p>
                                            JHA is my last name and also my platform, that of Jobs, Health, and Accountability. I discuss each of these points briefly, then in greater detail.
                                            <br><br>
                                            Firstly, let me speak to how I hope to bring about this change. I am a problem solver, not an ideologue. I don't accept or reject an idea based on my previous positions on that subject. I believe that if a rational argument can be made and if I can be convinced of a point, then the decision is made. If a mistake is made, I see no issue in owning up to it, and moving directly along to another solution. That is how I hope to govern. Not as a politician, but as an engineer. By trying to fix our problems rather than inflate my ego.
                                            <br><br>
                                            By jobs, I refer to all manner of jobs: blue collar, white collar, and student jobs. I believe that encouraging businesses to open and by reducing property taxes, we can increase employment and the quality of life in West Lafayette.
                                            <br><br>
                                            By health, I refer to the environmental, fiscal, civic, and sexual health of our city and its residents. I maintain that we should increase environmental responsibility in West Lafayette and take steps to reduce our waste output and carbon footprint. As a proud defender of responsible spending, I believe that the State Street project should be done for the best value possible and that all waste on behalf of the city ought to be minimized. For civic health, I refer specifically to our infrastructure and amenities in town, which, though slated for improvement, still have room for growth. Finally, for sexual health, I believe students and residents should be made aware of the contraceptive options available to them and the dangers of sexually transmitted disease. This, along with programs to improve public health and reduce the incidents of sexual violence, ought to reduce the rate of these diseases and crimes in West Lafayette.
                                            <br><br>
                                            By accountability, I refer to being open, accessible, and accountable to all of my constituents and the residents of West Lafayette. From day one, I have believed in balancing the demands of the students with the needs of the community. I maintain my commitment to voicing student concerns and assuaging any and all doubts and confusion about my positions on the issues. I may be reached at any time at my email, jhaa@purdue.edu, and at my personal phone number, 630-309-9580.
                                            <br><br>
                                            Read on for a discussion of these issues in greater depth:

										<h3 class="issue-title">Jobs</h3>
										<p>
                                        America was founded on the principles of industry and free enterprise. In fact, the root cause of our revolution was British legislation that interfered with American business and free commerce. To that end, I believe that the key to a successful West Lafayette is a West Lafayette that is bustling with businesses and employment.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Blue Collar Jobs:
                                        <br>
                                        For those who may be unaware, I am entirely self-funding my campaign. I earned this money through a summer job at a factory in Romeoville, IL. While there, I primarily interacted with the associates who worked on the assembly lines, hardworking blue-collar folk. I truly believe that manufacturing and industry are the bedrock of the American middle class and to that end, I make it one of my explicit goals to bring manufacturing jobs to West Lafayette. The example set by Subaru and General Electric on the other side of the river is fantastic and I hope to see more such industry come to our side as well. To this end, I propose tax incentives for new factories constructed in West Lafayette. One of the greatest barriers to entry is our property tax that, at 0.96% is dangerously close to the Indiana cap of 1% of a property's assessed value. By waiving the property tax for the first year and gradually scaling it up linearly to the current rate over the following five years, we can give factories the opportunity to sort out their expenses, move over, and hire local employees. After all, job security and happiness are crucial components of the American Dream.
                                        <br><br>
                                        White Collar Jobs:
                                        <br>
                                        Purdue produces among the most talented Scientists, Engineers, Agriculture Students, and others across the board. It strikes me as a great tragedy that so much of this talent leaves town for locations like Indianapolis and Chicago. I get it, but it's still sad. I believe the key reason is that students don't see much of an opportunity here after graduation. To that end, steps that the University has taken with respect to Discovery Park, Purdue Research Park, the new Aviation complex, and other public-private partnerships are steps in the right direction, but I believe more has to be done. I particularly admire the Anvil, a new incubator intended to help student startups get from 0 to 1 in the implementation process. I think the best way for students to be successful and remain in West Lafayette is to be gainfully employed. To that end, I'd apply my property tax benefit to student and alumni-run corporations as well. The only exception would be that the 5 year window during which property taxes would be lowered would be expanded to 10 years for businesses run by at least one Purdue student or alumnus. By promoting student entrepreneurship, especially within the high-tech sector, we can develop West Lafayette into a hub of innovation. I'm being wildly optimistic, but perhaps within a decade, the Wabash Valley may well be the Silicon Valley of the Midwest.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Student Jobs:
                                        <br>
                                        While both Blue Collar and White Collar jobs play into student employment, particularly student self-employment, I'd also like to attract more service industry into the Chauncey area to make it more attractive to students and increase student employment opportunities during their period of study. West Lafayette was recently ranked the worst college town in the big 10 and I believe that with more restaurants, bars, nightclubs, novelty shops, and other businesses, we can truly expand both student enjoyment and appreciation for all that the city has to offer. The same property tax incentive would apply with a 5 year decreased tax that would start from 0% and would increase linearly to the prevailing rate. Furthermore, as with all plans, once sufficient businesses were attracted to town, the increase in the tax base would enable us, on behalf of West Lafayette, to reduce the overall property tax of the town as a whole, encouraging students to settle here. With most of Chauncey area controlled by rental companies that would likely charge the same rent to businesses even if a property tax waiver were enacted, I propose that instead of suspending property tax, the property tax still be collected from the rental company, but then a portion of it be returned to the business as a subsidy on their rent. This will effectively transfer the property tax benefit not to the rental company, but to the intended business. Another interesting idea would be to require businesses to include sales tax in the listed price. If every other civilized country does it, I don't think it would be too difficult for us in West Lafayette to do it either. I admit, I'm a simple man; when I see a $1.00 price tag, I ought to be able to pay for the good with a dollar bill and nothing more.

										<h3 class="issue-title">Health</h3>
										<p>
                                        Health is a fairly broad area of discussion. I outline here some specific points.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Environmental Health:
                                        <br>
                                        There is only one planet on which human civilization exists. If we ruin this planet, we have nowhere to go. Therefore, out of evolutionary necessity, I am a conservationist and a pragmatic environmentalist. The key environmental issue which concerns me is the dumping of raw, untreated sewage into the Wabash river 22 times within the past year. Interestingly, the city's capacity to handle sewage works fine during most situations and it is only during significant downpours that this ability is compromised. In these situations, the facilities are overstressed and waste must, therefore, be dumped. This dumping is reprehensible. To resolve this, instead of building a costly reservoir, I propose increased rain gardens and environmental features involving native deep-rooted prairie grasses that will cost-effectively trap a majority of the rainwater and prevent it from overwhelming the sewage and drainage systems. This will also work toward reducing the impact of large puddles on Purdue's campus (and throughout the city) which can appear unseemly, degrade the condition of roads, and act as a hazard for vehicles and pedestrians. Increasing the presence of rain gardens, especially in conjunction with Purdue's Environmental and Ecological Engineering department, can reduce our carbon footprint while improving the aesthetic qualities of the city. If these are integrated as part of the State Street Master Plan, then that would be all for the better. Furthermore, most of the energy generated in Indiana comes from coal, which is a highly polluting source. I would like to see us in West Lafayette eventually transition toward greener sources of energy, preferably nuclear. This is a long-term action item, however, so it may not be feasible in the short term. We already are taking laudable steps like using food waste from Purdue's dining courts for biofuel and bioenergy and I think increasing programs like these and perhaps incorporating a city-wide compost program may be beneficial.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Fiscal Health:
                                        <br>
                                        I think deficit spending is risky and counter to common sense. I admit, there are many situations in which it is necessary, but as a small local government, most of these situations (like wars, economic disasters, etc.) do not generally apply. I am very proud of the current financial situation of the city and I strongly disapprove of any increased expenditure unless a clear benefit can be shown. For instance, unlike my opponents, I do not think it would be prudent to expand the West Lafayette Police Department but rather to integrate it closer with Purdue's own police department and cut costs by eliminating redundancies between the two systems. We have to work smarter and leaner as a city, not bulkier and clumsier. Furthermore, I would support measures to reduce the property tax after the growth of a significant tax base. This would serve to reward the citizens for the financial prudence of the city. Also, it would be beneficial to require the city to have a balanced budget as an insurance measure against excessive spending in the future. The key issue as far as fiscal health, however, is the State Street redesign. This project has a projected cost of between 60 and 100 Million Dollars. That is a 40 million dollar swing and I want to ensure that we get the best value for our money. I'm not a cheapskate and wouldn't by any means advocate for a shoddy job to lower the final price. Rather, I look for the best value for our money, to ensure that we are getting quality without bloat.
                                        <br><br>
                                        
                                        Civic Health:
                                        <br>
                                        The primary project that impacts the health of our city and our infrastructure is the State Street redesign. I want to make sure that it happens in a fashion that is in harmony with the needs of campus. State street should be a unifying factor on campus, not a dividing one. For instance, the fences placed along Northwestern avenue were not a great decision, especially considering Purdue's expansion to Wang Hall on the other side. I want to make sure that the plants we place in State Street's medians do not significantly hinder the transit of students from one side to the other and that there exist sufficient crossing points. I'm very excited about the bike paths along State Street and, as a cyclist, would like to see increased opportunities for cycling in the local community. It should be entirely feasible for a student owning a cycle to get around town without the fear of being hit by another vehicle. More limited access biking paths would further help to emphasize the difference between vehicular traffic, pedestrian traffic, and cycles. For other infrastructure projects, I'd like to see all unpaved roads in West Lafayette paved, as funding allows. It would also be nice to see the riverfront area developed into a nice Riverwalk promenade, with shops, lighting, and benches for pedestrians. This can be a major draw, especially if it can be developed into something similar to that in my hometown of Naperville, Illinois.   Bringing our city and our infrastructure into the 21st century is essential to our civic health, and this applies to our technology as well. As an electrical engineer, I'd hope to have the techncal expertise and the connections to bring in qualified folks to overhaul the city's website and IT departments. We must make use of the best technology to become a truly world-class city.
                                        
                                        <br><br>
                                        
                                        Sexual Health:
                                        <br>
                                        There are two problems which, together, are responsible for most problems pertaining to sexual health here in West Lafayette. These are ignorance of sexual health resources and sexual violence. The solution to ignorance is quite simple: education. A great number of students come to Purdue from schools with abstinence-only sex education and, while I feel that abstinence is the best choice for me, I think it is only prudent that students know their options. It's folly to believe that college students won't have sex and those that choose to do so should be aware of the contraceptive options available. There exists a great deal of misinformation surround contraceptives and their use and a frank and open conversation about the proper usage and associated risks would be helpful for students to evaluate their options. Furthermore, there also exists significant misinformation about sexually transmitted diseases and infections. All students should be made aware that certain diseases are incurable and can remain benign for years without an outbreak while still remaining infectious to sexual partners. Responsible education in this regard can help reduce the rate of sexually transmitted disease not only at Purdue but also in the surrounding community. The best way to go about spreading this information would be through semiannual classes and seminars, perhaps coinciding with Boiler Gold Rush and Winter Break, for both students and the community. These seminars could cover not only contraceptive options and sexually transmitted disease, but also consent law and the circumstances under which it can and cannot be granted. Furthermore, these seminars can conclude with free testing for STD's for those individuals interested. Such testing is also available for free at PUSH semiannually, so these programs could potentially be linked. Educating students and residents on consent as well as informing them to drink responsibly (if they do choose to drink) would also be a significant step toward reducing the incidents of sexual assault on campus and in West Lafayette. Alcohol is a significant (though not by any means the only) factor in several of the sexual assaults on campus and individuals should be made aware that consuming alcohol can impact the judgment and perception not only of the victims, but also of the perpetrators. Responsible drinking and ample precautions will hopefully reduce the rate of these terrible crimes. Again, I think the primary focus of our efforts ought to be on preventing these crimes from taking place. After the fact, though, I agree that the Purdue and West Lafayette police ought to receive training to better handle these cases. Infrastructure improvements, such as increased lighting and more police call boxes throughout the city can also help to prevent these crimes. I think it's atrocious that I as a male can freely walk about town without a concern at two in the morning while a female would fear doing so due to the risk of sexual assault. Although West Lafayette and Purdue are fairly safe, there's a lot of room for improvement in the areas of sexual assault and sexual health.

										<h3 class="issue-title">Accountability</h3>
										<p>
                                        It's a lengthy platform isn't it? Who would have thought that three letters, three words, could have meant so much? Moving on to accountability, it's fairly simple.
                                        <br><br>
                                        My views on accountability:
                                        <br>
                                        Accountability to me is virtually synonymous with responsibility. To me, it means owning up to my mistakes and taking credit for my successes. It means always remembering that I am a servant of the people and serve at their will. Never, never should a public servant think of his needs before those of his constituents. Never should a statesman's creeping thoughts of elitism corrupt the power granted in good faith by an eager public. I believe that we are all equal. Regardless of age, sex, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, background, citizenship status, religion, socioeconomic class, and education. All people are, simply, people. Every individual has a unique viewpoint and a valuable one. My job is not to make decisions for the people because I am somehow better than them, no, my job is to inform the public, to take their views into consideration, and to make the best decision for my constituents and for my city. This job, this public service is not about the individual, it is about the people.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Accessibility:
                                        <br>
                                        My phone number is 630-309-9580. I may be reached at any time by email at jhaa@purdue.edu. I live in room 801-W, Shreve Hall. You now know how to find me and how to get ahold of me. Being accessible to the public is a crucial part of my campaign. As a TA for ENGR 141, I've learned that office hours are a great way to receive public feedback and I fully intend to implement a similar system of office hours after the election. Following the example set by one of my role models, PSG Engineering Senator Giovanni Malloy, I will post the items up for discussion in advance of city council meetings and solicit constituent input via social media. During meetings, I will make my own version of the events available. Afterward, I will describe how I voted on each bill and why I voted the way I did. Steps like these will help resolve the state of political apathy from which our generation suffers and move us closer toward being more informed. An informed populace is one that can fight for its liberties and take them back from those forces that would gladly see them disappear. This is my goal for the West Lafayette citizenry. I'll also try to keep all the residence hall club presidents informed of local affairs, swing by a few of the weekly meetings, meet with floor senators and RAs, and ensure that I hear evenly and fairly any constituent who wants to chat.
                                        <br><br>
                                        
                                        Transparency:
                                        <br>
                                        I believe that the government is the people. To that end, an important part of accountability is being open and accessible to the public. I maintain that West Lafayette does a fairly good job in this regard, as City Council meetings are in the evenings when citizens can attend, but there is also significant room for improvement. I'd like to upload audio recordings of the meetings onto the website immediately after meetings take place. Furthermore, I'd like to release the items up for discussion to the website as early as possible , so the public has sufficient time to analyze them and formulate clear opinions about their positions. I consider myself a staunch defender of the 4th amendment and, also, a strict constitutionalist. I hope to see a West Lafayette where personal privacy is sufficiently protected while the government is as open and accessible as it possibly can be.
										</p>
                                        <p>
                                        That concludes my platform. If you have any questions or any other issues that you think are worthy of discussion, please reach out and let me know. 
                                        </p>
										<!--<h3 class="issue-title">Student Involvement</h3>
										<p>
											Our city government must be transparent and accessible to the people. I will
											actively work toward ensuring that students and their ideas are welcome inputs
											in our local government. I’ll be very honest here, most students don’t really care
											about politics. We are only here for four years, right? Why should we care? Quite
											simply, politics runs the world and, to that end, it is vital for students to feel
											involved as a part of the political process. Students should feel as if they are
											crucial members of the community and that their voice matters. With me, it will. I
											am always willing to lend my ear to a new plan or a new proposal, provided that it
											can be sustainably funded and have long-term benefits.  Another thing to consider
											is the matter of legacy. Students, what do you want to leave behind for the coming
											generations of Boilermakers? I can help us work toward permanent improvements,
											especially with respect to the State Street redesign, to Purdue and to West Lafayette
											that will stand for years to come.

										<h2>Working For You</h2>
										<p>
											My name is Aseem Jha and I am the Republican candidate for West Lafayette
											City Council from the Third District. I believe that together, we can take
											advantage of this great opportunity for self governance. Purdue has already
											become something of a national sensation after the innovative measures being
											tried at the administrative level. By having a voice in the city government
											that truly represents you, that will stand up for your freedom, that will
											fight to ensure that every dollar is justly spent, we can show that our
											generation and our school is ready to step up, take the reins, and rework
											democracy to work for the people.
