											<h2>The Issues</h2>
											<h3>These are a few key issues I'd like to address</h3>
										</header>
										<h3 class="issue-title">Reasonable Pricing</h3>
										<p>
											I believe that the United States lags behind the rest of the world in a significant
											way: we do not include the sales tax in our listed prices. I would advocate for an
											ordinance in the city of West Lafayette that would require businesses to display a
											price that includes all applicable taxes on any goods available for purchase. This 
											would have no impact on the way businesses operate aside from changing the displays
											and signage. The receipts would still include the product price and the tax separately
											for the convenience of the consumer.
										</p>
										<h3 class="issue-title">A Counter-Clockwise Bus Loop</h3>
										<p>
											Like a great many of you, I have known the frustration of deciding
											between taking the bus and walking to class in sub-zero and sub-optimal
											conditions. Why, then, do the current bus loops only proceed in a
											clockwise fashion? Why must we go all the way around campus to get
											to a location which would be far closer if we went the other way? I think
											this is an easily resolved issue, with benefits for students and faculty alike.
											I will work with CityBus toward a new loop to proceed along a route similar to
											the existing Silver Loop, but  in the opposite direction. This is prudent, inexpensive,
											and necessary.
										</p>
										<h3 class="issue-title">Drainage</h3>
										<p>
											The issue of drainage encompasses two areas of concern: drainage on campus, and
											drainage into the Wabash. With respect to the former, the numerous
											persistent puddles (or perhaps, small lakes) after a rainstorm or a hefty
											snowfall result in a great inconvenience to students. Ideally, if we could
											proceed with installing better-designed drainage systems, we could channel the
											flow of the water into our drains. Heck, if the Romans could do it, so can we!
											<br>
											<br>
											The other issue concerns the dumping of raw sewage into the Wabash. I was shocked
											to find out that the city’s sewage system is ill-equipped to handle
											large rainstorms and, in the event of such a storm, there are not enough facilities
											to process the sewage and the rainwater. What happens? You guessed it, the raw,
											untreated sewage flows straight into our river! By expanding our overflow capacity
											at the municipal level. We can work toward lowering the environmental impact of
											these policies.
										</p>
										<h3 class="issue-title">Student Involvement</h3>
										<p>
											Our city government must be transparent and accessible to the people. I will
											actively work toward ensuring that students and their ideas are welcome inputs
											in our local government. I’ll be very honest here, most students don’t really care
											about politics. We are only here for four years, right? Why should we care? Quite
											simply, politics runs the world and, to that end, it is vital for students to feel
											involved as a part of the political process. Students should feel as if they are
											crucial members of the community and that their voice matters. With me, it will. I
											am always willing to lend my ear to a new plan or a new proposal, provided that it
											can be sustainably funded and have long-term benefits.  Another thing to consider
											is the matter of legacy. Students, what do you want to leave behind for the coming
											generations of Boilermakers? I can help us work toward permanent improvements,
											especially with respect to the State Street redesign, to Purdue and to West Lafayette
											that will stand for years to come.
										</p>
										<h3 class="issue-title">Business</h3>
										<p>
											These are changing times for the Greater Lafayette Area. The recent development of
											the Anvil and other such incubators bodes well for the future of entrepreneurship
											in the area. Increasing funding and the new GE factory seem to suggest that manufacturing
											is here to stay. I believe that a balanced economy contains a healthy mix of agriculture,
											manufacturing, services, and high-tech startups. To this end, I believe that attracting
											new business is crucial for the continued health and growth of West Lafayette. By giving
											businesses incentives to come here and hire locally, we can build a more prosperous and
											wealthy community. Increasing student retention is also very important; although we produce
											some of the most talented scientists, engineers, agricultural, and technical workers in the
											country, very few of them stay to enrich the community after graduation. By attracting more
											business, we can ensure more jobs for students during and after their time at Purdue.
											Initiatives like Purdue's research park are a great step in this direction, but increased
											enthusiasm at the city council level would only aid our growth.
										</p>
										<h3 class="issue-title">State Street Master Plan</h3>
										<p>
											I wholly endorse the larger aims of the State Street Master Plan, as I believe that it
											has the potential to entirely reinvigorate our downtown area. In this regard, my aim
											is to consolidate student feedback to ensure that the plans and the construction proceed
											in a fashion that is most amicable for both students, the community, and local businesses.
											What we make here will last for generations, so I want to make sure that we build it
											responsibly and with comprehensive student input.

										<h2>Working For You</h2>
										<p>
											My name is Aseem Jha and I am the Republican candidate for West Lafayette
											City Council from the Third District. I believe that together, we can take
											advantage of this great opportunity for self governance. Purdue has already
											become something of a national sensation after the innovative measures being
											tried at the administrative level. By having a voice in the city government
											that truly represents you, that will stand up for your freedom, that will
											fight to ensure that every dollar is justly spent, we can show that our
											generation and our school is ready to step up, take the reins, and rework
											democracy to work for the people.
