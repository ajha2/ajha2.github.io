											<h3>Responsibility, Service, Transparency</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											My name is Aseem Jha, and I am currently a freshman studying Electrical Engineering.
											I am from Illinois originally, where my repeated exposure to the corruption and
											inefficiency of government in my own backyard drew me to public service. I am a problem
											solver by nature and I view government as a tool that can be made to work effectively for the
											people. Ultimately, I hope that my sense of pragmatism will help to bring the student
											body closer to the City of West Lafayette and to increase student involvement in civic
											matters. My goal is to resolve our problems in the most fiscally responsible way while
											still considering the needs of the greater community.

										<h2>Working For You</h2>
										<p>
											My name is Aseem Jha and I am the Republican candidate for West Lafayette
											City Council from the Third District. I believe that together, we can take
											advantage of this great opportunity for self governance. Purdue has already
											become something of a national sensation after the innovative measures being
											tried at the administrative level. By having a voice in the city government
											that truly represents you, that will stand up for your freedom, that will
											fight to ensure that every dollar is justly spent, we can show that our
											generation and our school is ready to step up, take the reins, and rework
											democracy to work for the people.
